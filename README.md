# odin-landing_page

This Project is to deepen my knowledge about "Flexbox" and how to set up a landing page in the web.

Key takeaways:

- Flexbox is perfect to place content on a x or y-axis.
- Google the stuff you don't know!!! (with MEANINGFUL prompts)
- Avoid rabbit holes.
- Work in a structured manner.
